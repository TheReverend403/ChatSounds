# This is a collection of lists of aliases for every sound that can be played in Minecraft.
# Since there are so many sounds, not all of them have been added here, however this plugin
# has been developed so that you can add sounds yourself, for example, if more sounds are
# added to Minecraft. More information on how to do this can be found on the BukkitDev page.
